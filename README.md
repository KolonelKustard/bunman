Bunman: Brennan JB7 Backup to Library Synchroniser

This application written in Java is a tool for my Dad to copy all his songs
ripped using his (excellent) Brennan JB7 to his iTunes library. I must confess
to having got carried away a little bit with this, but I thought I might as well
make something potentially useful to other people (and possibly their parents)
and not just a one off script.

A [Brennan JB7](http://www.brennan.co.uk/) is a really simple hifi appliance for
ripping CD's onto a built in hard disk. My dad loves his. However my brother
gave my dad his old iPod which caused a bit of a problem as there's no way to
get stuff from a Brennan JB7 into iTunes and therefore onto an iPod. However the
Brennan JB7 does have a way of backing up its library to a USB based removeable
storage device.

The backup format is ok but for some reason ID3 tags aren't written to the MP3
files generated by the Brennan JB7. So this tool copies the files from the
backup device to an iTunes (or other) library and puts the ID3 tags in so iTunes
(or other) can correctly figure out what all these files are about.
