				<h2>What the daddy-o?</h2>
				<p>
					Bun Man is a (free) program which helps you transfer all the
					music you've got on your Brennan JB7 to your computers
					iTunes (or other) library, and therefore onto your iPod (or
					other).
				</p>
				
				<h2>How to sync my Brennan to iTunes (or other)</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>
						Backup your Brennan JB7. Refer to the manual that came
						with your Brennan or see this web page:
						<a href="http://www.brennan.co.uk/itemcontent.php/content/usbanswers"
							target="_blank"
						>http://www.brennan.co.uk/itemcontent.php/content/usbanswers
						(opens in a new window)</a>.
					</li>
					<li>
						Plug your backup device into your computer using the
						same USB cable you used to plug it into your Brennan.
						Most likely your computer will pop open a window asking
						what you want to do next, to which you should choose
						"Do Nothing" (or words to that effect).
					</li>
					<li>
						Click the following &quot;Launch&quot; button to start
						up the Bun Man application:
						<script src="http://www.java.com/js/deployJava.js"></script>
						<script>
							deployJava.createWebStartLaunchButton(
									"http://kolonelkustard.github.io/bunman/bunman.jnlp",
									'1.6.0');
						</script>
					</li>
					<li>
						When asked about security and whether you trust this
						application you'll have to make your own judgement. I'm
						pretty certain there's nothing in it that will do
						anything bad to your computer, but that's taking the
						word of a stranger. The fact is that the application
						needs to be able to read the files in your backup and
						write to your iTunes (or other) library and, quite
						rightly, you will need to grant it those permissions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Assuming you've allowed the application to run you'll be
						prompted with what to do once it's started up. Good
						luck! x
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					Once the process has completed, should you add more items to
					your Brennan JB7 then just come back to this website and
					follow the above steps again.
				</p>
				
				<h2>What if I have a problem or need help?</h2>

					cannot be promised, but if you happen to have a friend who
					is handy with computers perhaps ask them for a hand.
