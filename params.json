{"name":"Bun Man","tagline":"Bun Man: Brennan JB7 Backup to Library Synchroniser","body":"## What the daddy-o?\r\n\r\nBun Man is a (free) program which helps you transfer all the music you've got on your Brennan JB7 to your computers iTunes (or other) library, and therefore onto your iPod (or other).\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to sync my Brennan to iTunes (or other)\r\n\r\n1. Backup your Brennan JB7. Refer to the manual that came with your Brennan\r\n2. Plug your backup device into your computer using the same USB cable you used to plug it into your Brennan. Most likely your computer will pop open a window asking what you want to do next, to which you should choose \"Do Nothing\" (or words to that effect).\r\n3. Click this button to start up the Bun Man application: \r\n4. When asked about security and whether you trust this application you'll have to make your own judgement. I'm pretty certain there's nothing in it that will do anything bad to your computer, but that's taking the word of a stranger. The fact is that the application needs to be able to read the files in your backup and write to your iTunes (or other) library and, quite rightly, you will need to grant it those permissions.\r\n5. Assuming you've allowed the application to run you'll be prompted with what to do once it's started up. Good luck! x\r\n\r\nOnce the process has completed, should you add more items to your Brennan JB7 then just come back to this website and follow the above steps again.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What if I have a problem or need help?\r\n\r\nRaise an issue here: <https://github.com/KolonelKustard/bunman/issues>. Sadly there's no SLA and response times cannot be promised, but if you happen to have a friend who is handy with computers perhaps ask them for a hand.","google":"UA-41073121-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
